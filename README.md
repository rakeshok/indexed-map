# IndexedMap

A map that maintains the order of entries. Give access to entries by index or key.
Keys have to be unique in map.

## Install

```bash
npm install indexed-map --production
```

## Usage

```js
var IndexedMap = require('indexed-map')
var myMap = IndexedMap();
// add an entry
myMap.insert('myKey', { myProperty:'My Value' });
```

Keys have to be of type 'string', values can by any type, there is no restrictions.


### Constructor

* `var myMap = IndexedMap();`
* `var myMap = new IndexedMap();`

Keyword `new` is optional, it will be called by IndexedMap itself, if necessary. 

### properties

* `length` {number} the count of entries

* `keys` {Array} keys in the current order
	
	That is not a clone, it is the real keys array of the indexedMap. So do not 
	add, change or remove elements. That would result in an inconsistent state of indexedMap itself.
	
	The advantage of not cloning the key map is, that you can easily manipulat the order of keys, if you like.
	So you could use the reverse or sort method of Array.

### _key_ based methods:

* `insert( key:string, value:any ):value|null`

	Insert new element before the referenced element targetKey.
	If reference is null or not found, new element is inserted at the end of the list.
	If key always used in the map, null will be returned.

* `set( key:string, value:any )oldValue|null`

	Overwrite the value for the given key.
	*return* old value or null, if key not found.

* `move( key:string, targetKey:string )value|null`
* `remove( key:string ):oldValue|null` 
* `has( key:string ):boolean`
* `get( key:string ):value|null` 
* `nextOf( key:string ):key|null`
* `prevOf( key:string ):key|null`
 
### _index_ based equivalent with sufix 'At':

* `getAt( index:number ):value|null`
* `setAt( index:number, value:any ):oldValue|null`
* `insertAt( index:number, value:any ):value|null`
* `moveAt( index:number, targetIndex:number ):value|null`
* `removeAt( index:number ):oldValue|null`

###  first, last, previous, next:

* `getFirst():value|null`
* `getLast():value|null`
* `getPrevOf( key:string ):value|null`
* `getNextOf( key:string ):value|null`

### iterating methods

* `sort(callback)`
	sort the map, that method manipulate the indexedMap.
	This function is analog to the sort function of Array.
	if no callback is specified, keys will be sorted lexicographically

	*params* callback {function(valueA, valueB ):number } - optional
	- called in context of indexedMap
	- compareFunction have to return _0_ for equal, _<0_ for a < b or _>0_ for a > b

* `find(callback)`
	return the first key, where callback(key, value) returned true.  
	
	*param* callback {function(key:string, value:object):boolean} - required
	 - called for every entry in context of indexedMap. return true will stop the search and
	   return the value of current entry.
	
	*param* startIndex {number} - optional
		position to start the search, default: 0
	
	*returns* value or null

* `each(callback)`
	Visit every entry in the indexedMap. Start at given startIndex. Run until end 
	or the given callback returns 'false'.

	*param* callback {function(key:string, value:object):boolean} - required
	- called for every entry in context of current IndexedMap. 
	- stop loop from within the callback function by returning false.
	
	*param* startIndex {number} - optional
		position to start the run, default: 0

	*returns* null
